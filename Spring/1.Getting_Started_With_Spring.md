# Getting Started with Spring

This docs is for [First_Lesson](./First_Lesson/).

## Tightly Coupled

In Spring, `Tightly Coupled` application would be known as `Monolithic`. This means that we've defined a static type for the `GameRunner` Class and when we want to run another Class into the `GameRunner` constructor, we would need to change the code.

- **Coupling**: How much work is involved in changing something.
  - An `engine` is tightly coupled to a `Car`. => `Tightly Coupled`.
  - A `wheel` is loosely coupled to a `Car`. => `Loosely Coupled`.

> Coupling is **even more important** in building **great software**.

Only thing constant in **Technology** is change.
  
- Business Requirements change.
- Frameworks change.
- Code changes.

> We want **Loose Coupling** *as much as possible* as to make functional changes with *as less code changes as possible*.

## What we want to achieve in Spring - Objective

```Java
var game = new MarioGame();
var gameRunner = new GameRunner(game);
gameRunner.run();
```

The code above shows that:

- `game` variable is a Dependency of `GameRunner` Class:
  - We can say that the `game` variable is being `injected/wired` into the `GameRunner` Class.

> In this case, we're managing and creating our own `Dependencies`. What we're trying to achieve is to have `Spring` manage and create our `Dependencies`

Here's some illustration on what's going on:

- What we're currently doing:

- What we want to do using `Spring`:

## Java Sprinng Bean

Steps to start:

- Launch a Spring Context - On `AppHelloWorldSpring.java`:

```Java
var helloWorldContext = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(HelloWorldConfiguration.class);
```

- Configure things that we want Spring to manage, `@Configuration`. - On `HelloWorldConfiguration.java`:

```Java
@Configuration // Specify @Configuration
public class HelloWorldConfiguration {

    @Bean // Specify the Bean Method
    public String name(){
        return "Test Name";
    }
}
```

> `@Configuration` is a Class.

- Retrieving Beans managed by Spring:

```Java
System.out.println(helloWorldContext.getBean("name"));
helloWorldContext.close(); // Close the context once done
```

## Auto Wiring

We can use other `Spring Beans` by auto wiring rather than method calling:

```Java
@Configuration
public class HelloWorldConfiguration {

    @Bean
    public String name(){
        return "Test Name";
    }
    
    @Bean(name = "age2")
    public int age(){
        return 420;
    }

    @Bean
    public Person person(String name, int age2){
        return new Person(name, age2);
    }
}
```

## Listing all Spring Beans

We can list all the **Spring Beans** methods in the `@Configuration` from the context. Using `getBeanDefinitionNames()` method, we can loop around the array:

```Java
var context = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(TestConfiguration.class);
Arrays.stream(context.getBeanDefinitionNames()).forEach(System.out::println);
```

## Multiple Same Type of Beans

When we have the same return type of **Spring Beans** and we use the `Class Object` to get a **Bean**, **Spring** will throw an `Exception`. What we can do is tell Spring we want a certain method to be the `Primary` candidate.

```Java
@Configuration
public class TestConfiguration {
    @Bean
    public String name(){
        return "Test Name";
    }

    @Bean
    public String roadName(){
        return "Pyronautica Street";
    }
    
    @Bean(name = "age")
    public int age(){
        return 420;
    }

    @Bean
    @Primary
    public Address address(){
        return new Address("Here", 72837);
    }

    @Bean
    public Address address2(String roadName, int age){
        return new Address(roadName, age);
    }
}
```

```Java
var context = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(TestConfiguration.class);
context.getBean(Address.class);
```

> Spring will then choose the `Primary` candidate

Another way we can tell Spring we can a certain parameter instead of a regular one is `@Qualifier`:

```Java
@Configuration
public class TestConfiguration {
    @Bean
    @Primary
    public Address address(){
        return new Address("Here", 72837);
    }

    @Bean
    @Qualifier("address2qual")
    public Address address2(String roadName, int age){
        return new Address(roadName, age);
    }

    @Bean
    public Something something(String roadName, int age,  @Qualifier("address2qual") Address address){
        return new Something(roadName, age, address);
    }
} 
```

```Java
context.getBean("address2qual");
```

## What's a Spring Container?

**Spring Container** manages `Spring beans` & their lifecycle. It is also called **Spring Context** or **IOC Container** (Inversion of Control). There are 2 popular types of **Spring Containers**:

1. `Bean Factory`: **Basic Spring Container**.
2. `Application Context`: **Advanced Spring Container** with enterprise-specific features:
  ~ Easy to use in web applications
  ~ Easy internationalization
  ~ Easy integration with **Spring AOP**

Most enterprise applications use `Application Context`.

- Recommended for web applications, web services - REST API and microservices.

## POJO vs Java Bean vs Spring Bean

- **Java Bean**: Classes adhering to 3 contraints:
  - Have public default(no argument) constructors
  - Allow access to their properties using getter and setter methods
  - Implement java.io.Serializable
- **POJO** - Plain Old Java Object:
  - No constraints
  - Any Java Object is a POJO
- **Spring Bean**: Any Java object that is managed by Spring
