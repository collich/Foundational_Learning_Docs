# Learning H2, JPA and Hibernate in Spring Boot

## Enabling the H2 Console

To enable the H2 In-Memory Database, `http://localhost:8080/h2-console`, we would need to add this line in the `application.properties` file:

```properties
spring.h2.console.enabled=true
```

> The database url will be dynamically generated each time the application starts.

### Static H2 URL

To get a static URL for H2, we would need to add this line into `application.properties`


```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:<url_name>

#Example
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:testdb
```

> This way, the url will always be `spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:testdb` when you restart your application.

### Next Step

Creating a `schema.sql` file in the same folder as `application.properties`.
