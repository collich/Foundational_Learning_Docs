# Learning H2, JPA and Hibernate in Spring Boot

- **H2**: In Memory Database
- **JPA**: Java/Jakarta Persistent API
- **Hibernate**: ORM (Object Relation Mapper) for Spring Boot

## Enabling the H2 Console

To enable the H2 In-Memory Database, `http://localhost:8080/h2-console`, we would need to add this line in the `application.properties` file:

```properties
spring.h2.console.enabled=true
```

> The database url will be dynamically generated each time the application starts.

### Static H2 URL

To get a static URL for H2, we would need to add this line into `application.properties`

```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:<url_name>

#Example
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:testdb
```

> This way, the url will always be `spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:testdb` when you restart your application.

### Next Step

Creating a `schema.sql` file in the same folder as `application.properties`.

### Using Spring to communicate with Database

We would have 2 files:

- A `@Repository` file and a `@Component` file

- `Example` - `@Repository` file - `CourseJdbcRepo.java`:

```Java
@Repository
public class CourseJdbcRepo {

    @Autowired
    private JdbcTemplate springJdbc;

    private static String INSERT_QUERY = """
            insert into course (id, name, author)
            values(1, 'Learn Discrete Math', 'Karin');
            """;

    public void insert(){
        springJdbc.update(INSERT_QUERY);
    }
}
```

> Methods in this Class file would use methods to directly communicate with the database.

- `Example` - `@Repository` file - `CourseJdbcRepo.java`:

```Java
@Component
public class CourseJdbcCommandLineRunnner implements CommandLineRunner{
    @Autowired
    private CourseJdbcRepo repository;

    @Override
    public void run(String... args) throws Exception {
        repository.insert();
    }
}
```

> Methods in this Class will `implements CommandLineRunner`. This interface, `CommandLineRunner`, have a `run` method which is to execute the `run` method upon launching the application. *Do also remember to do a `@ComponentScan` for Spring to identify the packages that needed to be scanned during runtime.*

## Query an Entry, Inserting and Deleting

We'll be using a `Course` class for this example:

```Java
public class Course {
    private long id;
    private String name;
    private String author;

    public Course(){
        
    }

    public Course(long id, String name, String author) {
        this.id = id;
        this.name = name;
        this.author = author;
    }

    // Getter

    public String getAuthor() {
        return author;
    }

    public long getId() {
        return id;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    // Setter
    public void setAuthor(String author) {
        this.author = author;
    }

    public void setId(long id) {
        this.id = id;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    // Other

    public String toString(){
        return String.format("");
    }
}

```

We will also be using the previous section examples of `CoursejdbcCLIRunner` and `CoursejdbcRepository`.

### Querying an Entry

To query an entry, the method we could use is `queryForObject()`:

```Java
private static SELECT_QUERY = "SELECT * FROM course WHERE id = ?";

public Course findByIndex(long id){
    return springJdbc.queryForObject(SELECT_QUERY, new BeanPropertyRowMapper<>(Course.class), id);
}
```

> - Do note that the `Course` class must have an **empty constructor** in order for this to compile. Also do use `BeanPropertyRowMapper<>()` class to **map each row** of data from the database.
> - Another thing to note is that since we want the output, we would need to use anything other than the `update` method as it only updates the database and doesn't return any item.

### Inserting

We can insert data using the `update` method:

```Java
private static INSERT_QUERY = "INSERT INTO course (id, name, author) VALUES (?, ?, ?);";

public void postCourse(Course course){
    springJdbc.update(INSERT_QUERY, course.getId(), course.getName(), course.getAuthor())
}
```

### Deleting

For deleting, we would use the same method as [inserting](#inserting), `update`:

```Java
private static DELETE_QUERY = "DELETE FROM course WHERE id=?";

public void deleteCourse(long id){
    springJdbc.update(DELETE_QUERY, id);
}
```
