# Using Spring Framework to Create and Manage Java Objects

## Primary vs Qualifier

- `@Primary` - A bean should be given preference when multiple candidates are qualified
- `@Qualifier` - A specific bean should be auto-wired (name of the bean can be used as qualifier)
- Always think from the perspective of the class using the `@Component`
  - Just `@Autowired` - Uses `@Primary`
  - `@Autowired` + `@Qualifier`: I only want ot use specific `@Component`.
  - `@Qualifier` has a higher priority than `@Primary`
