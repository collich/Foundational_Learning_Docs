# Spring Boot Web Application

## Configuration

We can change the **Web App** ports by going into the application.properties and specify using:

```properties
sever.ports=<port_number>

#Example
server.port=8081
```

## Returning String to Response Body

In order for a String to be returned, we would need to add the `@ResponseBody` **Annotation**:

```Java
@Controller
@RequestMapping
public class SayHelloController {

    @GetMapping("/hello")
    @ResponseBody
    public String sayHello() {
        return "Hello World!";
    }
}
```

- We would also need to annotate that we're using this class as the `Controller` with `@Controller`.
- We would also want to add `@RequestMapping` to tell **Spring**.
