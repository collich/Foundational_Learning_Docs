# Spring Boot Web Application

## Configuration

We can change the **Web App** ports by going into the `application.properties` and specify using:

```properties
sever.ports=<port_number>

#Example
server.port=8081
```

### JSP Prefix and Suffix

To tell SpringBoot about the **JSP** `Prefix` and `Suffix`, we would add this to the `application.properties`:

```properties
spring.mvc.view.prefix=/src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/WEB-INF/jsp
spring.mvc.view.suffix=.jsp

# We can shorten the prefix as Spring knows a portion of the file path:
spring.mvc.view.prefix=/WEB-INF/jsp
spring.mvc.view.suffix=.jsp

```

## Returning Response

In order for a `String` to be returned, we would need to add the `@ResponseBody` **Annotation**:

```Java
@Controller
@RequestMapping
public class SayHelloController {

    @GetMapping("/hello")
    @ResponseBody
    public String sayHello() {
        return "Hello World!";
    }
}
```

- We would also need to annotate that we're using this class as the `Controller` with `@Controller`.
- We would also want to add `@RequestMapping` to tell **Spring**.

### Creating JSP

In order for **Spring** to use **View** part of **MVC**, we would need to create the directory `/src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/WEB-INF/jsp`.

All `.jsp` files will live in this folder. We can then add the **JSP** [Prefix and Suffix](#jsp-prefix-and-suffix).

The last step would be adding the Tomcat `dependency` under `pom.xml`.

- `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.tomcat.embed</groupId>
  <artifactId>tomcat-embed-jasper</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

After that, we would want to create a method under a controller:

```Java
@GetMapping("hello-jsp")
public String sayHelloJsp() {
    return "sayHello";
}
```

What's happening under the hood.

- **Spring** will be using **View Resolver** from the `application.properties`
- When we specify the `Prefix` and `Suffix`, we're telling **Spring** to look under the folder name `/WEB-INF/jsp`.
- The `String` we're returning have to be the same name as the file under `/WEB-INF/jsp`.
  - For this example, we're returning `sayHello`.
  - **Spring** would look for a `sayHello` file.
- Then **Spring** would then append the `Suffix` to the end of our returned `String`
  - In this case, we're appending `.jsp` on the `String` `sayHello`
  - This will in turn make the `String`: `sayHello.jsp`

## Request Params

What are **Request Parameters**? They are basically parameters that are being parsed into the `URL`.

A scenario:

- Example we've got a params like `?name=collich`, in `example.com/login?name=collich`.
- This params is being inputed when the user inputs their names.
- We would use `@RequestParam <Type> <name_of_params>`.
- In our scenario since we want the param `name`, it would be:

```Java
// example.com/login?name=collich
@GetMapping("login")
public String loginPage(@RequestParam String name){
  return "login";
}
```

> Notice that the method params follows the convention of the param like `?name`.
