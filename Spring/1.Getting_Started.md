## Tightly Coupled

In Spring, `Tightly Coupled` application would be known as `Monolithic`. This means that we've defined a static type for the `GameRunner` Class and when we want to run another Class into the `GameRunner` constructor, we would need to change the code.

- **Coupling**: How much work is involved in changing something.
  - An `engine` is tightly coupled to a `Car`. => `Tightly Coupled`.
  - A `wheel` is loosely coupled to a `Car`. => `Loosely Coupled`.

> Coupling is **even more important** in building **great software**.

Only thing constant in **Technology** is change.
  
- Business Requirements change.
- Frameworks change.
- Code changes.

> We want **Loose Coupling** *as much as possible* as to make functional changes with *as less code changes as possible*.
