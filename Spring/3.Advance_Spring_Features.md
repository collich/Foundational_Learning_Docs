# Spring Framework Advanced Features

## Initialisation

During runtime, the default initilisation of a `Bean/Component` is `Eager`. This means that regardless of whether the `Bean/Component` is being used or not, it is being initialised during **startup**. To defer the component from being initilised, we can place the `@Lazy` annotation.

```Java
@Component
@Lazy // Use this annotation.
public class ClassB{
    // Some code
}

@Configuration
public class SomeApp{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        try(var context = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(SomeApp.class)){
            // The Bean will initialise at this point after AnnotationConfigApplicationContext
            context.getBean(ClassB.class);
        }
    }
}
```

> Only when we're using `ClassB`, it will then be initialised. It can be used on any `@Component` or `@Bean`

- Default initialization for Spring Beans: **Eager**.
- **Eager** initialisation is recommended:
  - Errors in the configuration are discovered immediately at application startup.
- However you can configure beans to be lazily initialised using `Lazy` annotation:
  - **Not recommended** (`AND`) **Not frequently used**.
- `Lazy` annotation:
  - Can be used almost everywhere `@Component` and `@Bean` are used.
  - Lazy-resolution proxy will be injected instead of actual dependency.
  - Can be used on Configuration (@Configuration) class.

## Eager vs Lazy Initialisation

| What happens if there are errors in initialising | Errors will result in `RunTimeException`                          | Errors will prevent application from starting up |
| Usage                                            | Rarely Used                                                       | Very frequently used                             |

| Recommended Scenario                             | Beans very rarely used in your app                                | Most of your beans                               |

## Spring Beans Scopes

By default, all `Instances of a Class` is `Singleton`. Which is to say that all initialised Class is shared.
To learn more of the `Design Patterns` about `Singleton`, [click here](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/singleton).
To learn more of the `Design Patterns` about `Prototype`, [click here](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/prototype).

- Spring Beans are defined to be used in a specific scope:
  - `Singleton`: **One object instance** per Spring IoC container.
  - `Prototype`: **Possibly many object instances** per Spring IoC container.
- Scopes applicable ONLY for web-aware Spring ApplicationContext:
  - `Request`: **One object instance** per single HTTP request.
  - `Session`:**One object instance** per single HTTP session
  - `Application`: **One object instance** per single web application runtime.
  - `Websocket`: **One object instance** per single WebSocket instance.
- **Java Singleton (GOF)** vs **Spring Singleton**:
  - **Spring Singleton**: **One object instance** per single Spring IoC container.
  - **Java Singleton (GOF)**: **One object instance** per JVM.

| Beans                | New bean instance created every time the bean is referred to | Same bean instance reused                                               |

| Code Snippet         | `@Scope(value=ConfigurableBeanFactory.SCOPE_PROTOTYPE)`      | `@Scope(value=ConfigurableBeanFactory.SCOPE_SINGLETON)` OR (By Default) |

### Prototype

Unlike `Singleton`, `Prototype` will create different instance of a Class every time a **Spring Bean** is called.

We can specify the `Prototype` Annotation by:

```Java
@Scope(value="prototype")
@Component
//Or
@Scope(value=ConfigurableBeanFactory.SCOPE_PROTOTYPE)
@Component
```

### PreDestroy and PostConstruct

We can initialise a method after the dependencies are being wired/injected. For this, we're going to use `@PostConstruct`.

We can call a method before an application is terminated or when the Bean is removed from context. For this, we would be using `PreDestroy`.

```Java
@Component
class SomeClass{
  private SomeDependency someDependency;
  public SomeClass(SomeDependency someDependency){
    this.someDependency = someDependency;
  }

  @PostConstruct // This method will run after the constructor injection.
  public void intialise(){
    someDependency.doSomething();
  }

  @PreDestroy // This method will execute just before the application stops.
  public void cleanup(){
    someDependency.doCleanup();
  }
}

@Component
class SomeDependency {

  public void doSomething(){
    System.out.println("Start Initilisation");
  }

  public void doCleanup(){
    System.out.println("Clean up");
  }

}
```

> The `doSomething` method will run immediately after the all the dependencies are wired/injected into the constructor.
