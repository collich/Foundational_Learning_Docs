## Different Types of SQL Joining Table

Understanding the different joins would require `Set Theory` from Discrete Math. So it's highly recommended to understand `Set Theory` before trying to understand.

- **Intersect**: `INNER JOIN`
- **Primary Table Set with Intersect**: `LEFT JOIN`
- **Secondary Table Set with Intersect**: `RIGHT JOIN`
- **Union**: `FULL JOIN`
